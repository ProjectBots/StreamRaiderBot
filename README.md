A bot for automated farming in Stream Raiders

We now have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/u7e5nTRaZQ)!


First Steps:  
click the "add a profile" under "Bot" to add a profile (this bot can handle a lot of accounts for auto farming).  
enter a profilename (dont need to be the account name).  
hit enter, a browser will open where you login to StreamRaiders.  
let the website load, then just close the browser.  
wait a few seconds until you see the profile.  
press the play button and watch how it farms for you.   
  
to prevent bans this bot will wait 100 - 720 sec before it checks the raids again.

the guide can be opened under "Bot" (the guide is not up to date at the moment)
